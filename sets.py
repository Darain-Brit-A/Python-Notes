# Set = {} unordered and immutable we can add and remove but no duplicates are  shd be there

# sets
fruits = {"apple", "banana", "orange", "mango"}
print(fruits)

# can use len to find length, and we cant use indexing like fruits[0] because it is unordered
# we can add remove an element,pop a element which removes the first element but it is random we can even clear
